## Reporting a Vulnerability

If you discover a security vulnerability within the project, please report it to us as soon as possible. We take security seriously and appreciate your efforts to disclose the issue responsibly.

To report a vulnerability, please send an email to [rvicariodev@gmail.com](mailto:rvicariodev@gmail.com) with a detailed description of the vulnerability. We kindly request that you do not disclose the vulnerability publicly until we have had a chance to address it.

We are committed to responding to security vulnerability reports promptly and will provide regular updates on the progress of fixing the issue. Once a vulnerability is reported, our security team will assess the severity and impact of the issue and take appropriate actions to address it.

Depending on the severity and impact of the vulnerability, you can expect one of the following outcomes:

- **Accepted Vulnerability**: If the vulnerability is confirmed, we will work diligently to develop and release a fix as soon as possible. We will keep you informed about the progress and let you know when the fix is available.
  
- **Declined Vulnerability**: In some cases, vulnerabilities may not meet our criteria for severity or impact, or they may be out of scope for our project. If your report is declined, we will provide a detailed explanation of our decision and any recommended actions you can take.

We appreciate your cooperation and assistance in helping us maintain the security of the project. Thank you for your contributions!
